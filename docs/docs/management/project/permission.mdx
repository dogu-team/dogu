The permissions within a project are separate from the permissions within the organization.

Project permissions apply only within the project, and the organization owner or members with "Admin" or higher permissions within the organization have full access to all permissions within the project, regardless of project permissions or membership.

The project permissions are structured as follows:

- `Admin`: Has all permissions within the project.
- `Write`: Has all permissions within the project but cannot modify project members or settings.
- `Read`: Can view test results.
