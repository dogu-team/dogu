From `Dogu v1.2.0` onwards, self-hosted GitLab hosting is not supported for the test script repository. You can use GitHub and GitLab services to integrate with projects.

## Prerequisites

:::tip

You can check the repository example at https://github.com/dogu-team/dogu-routine-examples.

:::

1. Create a repository in a Git service.
2. Create a `dogu.config.json` file in the **root directory** with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "scriptFolderPaths": ["test"], // optional
     "workingDirPaths": ["selenium/typescript/jest"] // optional
   }
   ```

- `scriptFolderPaths`: Writes test scripts under the specified path. This is used when searching for scripts in the [Routine GUI editor](/routine/routines/editor).
- `workingDirPaths`: Executes the `dogu-actions/run-test` command at the specified path. This is used when locating the working directory in the [Routine GUI editor](/routine/routines/editor).

## Integration

:::info

To perform actions such as repository tree browsing, file retrieval, and cloning in Dogu, at least read permission for the repository is required.  
Please refer to the token generation pages for each Git service for more details.

:::

1. Go to the project page and click on the "Settings" menu in the left sidebar.
2. Click "Connect" button in the Git service list.

   />
3. Enter the Git token, and repository URL, then save.

   />

### Verify Integration

1. Go to the project page and click on the "Settings" menu in the left sidebar.
2. Check if the "Disconnect" button is displayed in the Git service.

   />
3. Go to the project page and click on the "Routines" menu in the left sidebar.
4. Click the `+` icon in the routine list.
5. Choose the GUI editor and check if the test script is loaded in the "Run test" action.
