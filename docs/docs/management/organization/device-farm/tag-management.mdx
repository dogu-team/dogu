Device tags are pieces of information used to categorize and manage devices. They can be useful for organizing and managing devices based on different criteria. For example, device tags can be used to classify devices by region or group them into specific categories.

Device tags can be divided into two types: platform tags and custom tags. Platform tags are automatically added to devices based on their platform or operating system. Custom tags are user-defined and can be used to further categorize devices based on specific requirements or criteria.

:::tip

When conducting tests, device tags can be used to run tests specifically on devices belonging to a certain group or category.

## Platform tags

The platform tag is a tag that is automatically added based on the platform of the device when it is used.

**Platform tags cannot be modified or deleted.**
