## About Dogu

Dogu is a tool that automates repetitive testing in game development and visualizes test results to help you develop and test games more efficiently.  
You can directly use Dogu on [Dogu Console](https://console.dogutech.io).

## Features

Dogu provides the following features:

- Device farm
- Game test automation

### Device farm

You can manage your organization's devices on the Dogu console. You can freely share devices between organizations and sometimes restrict devices for use only in specific game projects. The devices don't have to be mobile devices. Desktop devices can also be managed on Dogu.

Through the device farm, you can remotely manage devices on the Dogu console even if they are physically separated. You can monitor the status of devices in real time, stream the device's screen in real time, and control the device.

Additionally, you can group devices and perform batch testing on devices belonging to a specific group.

### Game test automation

Dogu provides the Gamium SDK for automating game testing.

The Gamium SDK is a library that helps game developers communicate with Dogu to automate game testing. It provides APIs for communication with Dogu and APIs for delivering test results to Dogu.

Furthermore, it allows you to associate written game test scripts with device groups for execution.

You can view various test results on the Dogu console, such as device screen recording videos, device profiling information, game FPS information, and game logs.

## Self-Hosted

You can also install Dogu on your own server and use it.  
Please refer to the [Self-Hosted](/self-hosted/get-started) documentation for the guide.
