## Self-Hosted licenses

Community and Professional licenses are available for self-hosted environments.  
Please refer to the [Dogu Pricing](https://dogutech.io/pricing?type=self-hosted) page for details on features and pricing for each license.

**The default license is the Community license, and the Professional license must be purchased separately to use it.**  
You can purchase a professional license by applying for a trial and making an inquiry on the [Professional License](https://dogutech.io/pricing?type=self-hosted) page.
