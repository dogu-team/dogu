:::info PREREQUISITES

This document explains how to start game testing after setting up the device farm.

If you haven't set up the device farm yet, please refer to the [Quick start - Device farm](/get-started/tutorials/device-farm) guide to set up your device farm.

:::

## Download sample game

To start game testing, you can download the sample game provided by Dogu and give it a try.
The sample game can be downloaded from [Dogu RPG Sample](https://github.com/dogu-team/gamium-unity-samples/releases?q=DoguRpgSample&expanded=true).

1. Click on the provided link.
2. Download the `android.zip` or `ios.zip` file.
   <img

     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
3. Extract the compressed file and locate the `dogurpgsample` app file.

## Upload app to the project

1. Click on the "Apps" menu tab.
2. Click on the "Upload app" button.
   <img

     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
3. Upload the `dogurpgsample` app file.

     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />

## Write test scripts and integrate with Git

:::info

Dogu support GitHub and GitLab for Git integration.

:::

1. Refer to the [Gamium sample](https://github.com/dogu-team/dogu-examples/tree/main/typescript/gamium) GitHub repository to write your test scripts.
2. Follow the [Git Integration](/management/project/git-integration) documentation to integrate your project with a Git repository.

## Create routine

You can create and execute game tests as routines. Through routines, you can perform systematic and repetitive game testing.

1. Click on the "Routines" tab in the project page, then click the "+" button in the left sidebar.
   <img
     src="/img/console/project/create-routine.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
2. Click the "+" button in the "Device tags" section of the task, and select the tag you added to the Android device.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/routine-tag.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
3. Enable the device screen recording option.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/routine-record.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
4. In the "prepare" step, select the app you previously uploaded.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/routine-prepare.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
5. In the "run test" step, select the `dogurpgsample.test.ts` file.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/routine-script.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
6. Click the "Create" button to create the routine.

:::info Device screen recording

You can specify whether to record the screen when performing the task on the device. The recorded video can be viewed on the result page once the device task is completed.

:::

## Run routine

1. Click on the created routine in the left sidebar.
2. Click the "Run routine" button to start the routine, which will generate a pipeline as the routine is executed.

   <img
     src="/img/get-started/routine-run.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
   <br />

   :::caution Device connection status

   If the routine is not executing, please check the connection status of the device. Ensure that the device is in the "Online" state. If it is in the "Offline" state, please review the device connection process in the [Quick start - Device farm](/get-started/tutorials/device-farm) guide or refer to the [Device Troubleshooting](/device-farm/device/trouble-shooting) document for assistance.

3. Click on the created pipeline.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/pipeline-created.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />

## Check pipeline result

Once the pipeline is in progress or completed, you can check the results of the device job.

1. Click on "Jobs" in the left sidebar and select the device job.
   <img
     src="/img/routine/pipeline-live-sidebar.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
2. Review the test results. You can view recorded videos, logs, test reports generated from test scripts, device profile information, and more.

:::tip

For detailed information about test results, please refer to the [Test Reports](/test-report) documentation.

:::

## Wrap up

Have the game tests been performed successfully? Try testing games other than the sample game.

1. Create a new project in the Dogu console.
2. Refer to the [Gamium Engine SDK](https://gamium.dogutech.io/docs/engine/unity/project-configuration) to add the Gamium Engine SDK to the game you want to test and build it.
3. Refer to the [Routine Guide](/routine/routines) to create and execute routines, and then check the results.
