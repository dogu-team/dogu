## Building Infrastructure

In Dogu, there are two main components: **Host** and **Device**.
The Host serves as a hub to apply tests to multiple devices. The Device refers to the actual physical devices where the tests are executed. To connect the Host and the Devices, please physically connect the actual devices to the Host.

:::tip

The Host can also be used as a Device. For more information, refer to the [Host Management](/management/organization/device-farm/host-management) documentation.

```

This document describes the process based on one host and one device.

:::info Device configuration

To optimize the use of the device, please read the [Device Configuration](/device-farm/device/settings) document and make the necessary changes to the device settings.

:::

### Connect device

1. Prepare the configured device.
2. Physically connect the Android device to the host using a data transfer cable or hub that allows data transfer.

## Add host

:::info Prerequisites

1. Please visit the [Dogu Agent for Cloud](https://dogutech.io/downloads/dogu-agent) or [Dogu Agent for Self-Hosted](https://github.com/dogu-team/dogu/releases) page and select the appropriate platform for your host to install the latest Dogu Agent program.
2. Please refer to the [Agent Installation](/device-farm/host) page for the recommended specifications of the host.

:::

1. Click on the "Hosts" menu in the left sidebar within the organization section of the console.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/add-host.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
2. Click on the "Add new host" button, enter the host name, and complete the creation process.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/name-host.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
3. Copy the host token that you have received, then paste the copied token into the token input field in Dogu Agent to complete the connection.

     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/dost-token-input.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
4. Once the connection status of the created host in the console shows "Connected," the host registration is complete.

     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />

:::info

For detailed information about Dogu Agent and the host, please refer to the [Host](/device-farm/host) documentation.

If you are experiencing any issues during the process of adding a host, please refer to the [Host Troubleshooting](/device-farm/host) document for assistance.

## Add device

To build a device farm, add devices and group them using tags. The added devices can perform tasks such as test execution and remote control.

:::info

This document explains how to add Android devices.  
For iOS devices, additional configuration is required in Dogu Agent. Please refer to the [iOS Setting](/device-farm/host/macos/installation#ios-settings) documentation for more details.

:::

### Use device

1. Click on the "Devices" menu in the left sidebar within the organization section of the console, and then click on the "Standby devices" tab.
2. Click on the menu button(`···`) of the device you want to use, and then click on the "Start using" option.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/device-start-using.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
3. Select the project in which you want to use the device, and then complete the addition process.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/add-project-modal.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
4. Click on the "In-use devices" tab to check if the device has been successfully added.
   <img

     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />

:::caution Permissions and Public Devices

The Dogu console has the organization-level permission feature. Utilize the permission feature to freely designate members who can access test results or devices.

For public devices, all members or all projects have access to the devices (including streaming, remote control, and test execution).

For more information about the permission feature, please refer to the [Permission system](/management/organization/permission) documentation.

:::

:::info

For more detailed information about adding devices and related management tasks, please refer to the [Organization Device Management](/management/organization/device-farm/device-management) documentation.

If you encounter any issues during the process of adding devices, please refer to the [Device Troubleshooting](/device-farm/device/trouble-shooting) document for assistance.

### Attach device tag

You can group devices using device tags and execute tests on them.

:::tip Default tag

By default, devices are assigned platform tags based on their device platform when they are used.

:::

1. Click on the "Devices" menu in the left sidebar within the organization section of the console.
2. Click on the menu button(`···`) of the device to which you want to add tags, and then click on the "Edit tags" option.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/edit-tag-menu.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />

     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
4. Close the modal and check if the tag has been added to the device.
   <img
     src="/img/get-started/tag-check.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />

:::info

For more detailed information about device tags and their management within the organization, please refer to the [Organization Device Tag Management](/management/organization/device-farm/tag-management) documentation.

### Start device streaming

The added devices can be used for streaming or remote control functionalities.

1. Click on the "Devices" menu in the left sidebar within the organization section of the console.
2. Click on the menu button(`···`) of the device to which you want to stream or control remotely, and then click on the "Streaming" option.
   <img

     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />

## Wrap up

Device farm setup has been completed. Now, the added devices can be managed from the Dogu console.

Utilize features such as real-time device screen streaming, remote control, device tagging, and device project allocation to efficiently manage devices within the organization.

- For device streaming and remote control, refer to the [Device Streaming and Remote Control](/device-farm/device/streaming-and-remote-control) documentation.
- For device management capabilities, consult the [Device Management](/management/organization/device-farm/device-management) documentation.
