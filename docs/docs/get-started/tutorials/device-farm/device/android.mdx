:::info PREREQUISITES
Before using the devices, you need to have a host added. Refer to the [Adding a Host](/get-started/tutorials/device-farm/host) documentation for instructions on adding a host.

2. On the homepage, click the Devices menu in the left sidebar of your organization and select the "Pending Devices" tab.
3. If the connection is successful, you will see the available devices. Click the menu button (`···`) of the device you want to use and select "Start Using."

:::caution Permissions and Public Devices

The Dogu console has a permission feature within the organization. Use the permission feature to freely designate members who can access test results or devices.

For public devices, all members or all projects can access (streaming, remote control, test execution, etc.) the devices.

For more information on the permission feature, refer to the [Permission System](/management/organization/permission) documentation.
