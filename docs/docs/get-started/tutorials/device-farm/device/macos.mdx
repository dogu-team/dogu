:::info PREREQUISITES
Before using the devices, you need to have a host added. Refer to the [Adding a Host](/get-started/tutorials/device-farm/host) documentation for instructions on adding a host.
:::

Add devices and build a device farm by grouping them with tags. The added devices can be used for tasks such as test execution and remote control.

### Using the Devices

1. On the Host page, click the (`···`) button of the connected host and select "Use Devices."

:::caution Permissions and Public Devices

The Dogu console has a permission feature within the organization. Use the permission feature to freely designate members who can access test results or devices.

For public devices, all members or all projects can access (streaming, remote control, test execution, etc.) the devices.

For more information on the permission feature, refer to the [Permission System](/management/organization/permission) documentation.

### Setting Up Device Parallel Execution

When a host is used as a device, unlike Android and iOS, you can configure parallel execution during test execution. For example, when running web tests on a host, you can open multiple browsers for parallel execution.  
You can set the "Max Parallel Job Count" for macOS devices to determine the maximum number of tests that can be executed in parallel on the device.

1. On the Devices page, go to the "In Use Devices" tab, click the (`···`) button of the desired device, and select "Settings."

2. Set the "Max Parallel Job Count" and click the "Save" button.

:::info Max Parallel Job Count

The "Max Parallel Job Count" can be set according to your test execution requirements. For example, if you want to execute 2 tests in parallel on a single device, you can set the "Max Parallel Job Count" to 2.

:::

### Tagging Devices

You can group devices and execute tests using device tags.

:::tip Default Tags

By default, devices are tagged with the device's operating system when they are used.

:::

1. In the console, click on the Devices menu in the left sidebar of your organization.
2. Click the menu button (`···`) of the device to tag and select "Change Tags."

3. Enter the name of the tag to create and click the "Create Tag" button.
4. Verify that the tag has been added to the device.

   />

For more information about device tags, refer to the [Organization Device Tag Management](/management/organization/device-farm/tag-management) documentation.

### Device Streaming

Added devices can be used to stream real-time device screens.

1. In the console, click on the Devices menu in the left sidebar of your organization.
2. Click the menu button (`···`) of the device to stream and select "Streaming."

3. Device streaming will start.

## Conclusion

Manage devices within your organization using features such as real-time device screen streaming, remote control, device tags, and device project assignments.

- For device streaming and remote control, refer to the [Device Remote Control](/device-farm/device/streaming-and-remote-control) documentation.
- For device management features, refer to the [Device Management](/management/organization/device-farm/device-management) documentation.
- For device tag management features, refer to the [Device Tag Management](/management/organization/device-farm/tag-management) documentation.
