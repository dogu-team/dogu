# Action

The execution unit described under 'steps' in 'Tasks' is 'steps'.<br/>
And each step executes an 'action'.<br/>
Actions can run [Execute Shell Script](./run) or [Predefined Actions](/routine/actions/predefined-actions).<br/>

:::info
The action runs on the 'host' that is connected to the 'device' and controls the 'device'.

    subgraph deviceJob[device job on each device]
        start(start)
        subgraph steps
            subgraph step1
                action1(action)
            end
            subgraph step2
                action2(action)
            end
        end
        subgraph complete
            success(success)
            failure(failure)
        end
    end

    start --> action1
    action1 -- if succeeded --> action2
    action2 -- if succeeded --> success
