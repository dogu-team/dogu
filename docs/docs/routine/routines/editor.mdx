You can create routines in the Dogu console in two ways.

:::info Prerequisites

To create and execute routines, you need to link a Git repository that contains your test scripts.

For more details, please refer to the [Git Integration](/management/project/git-integration) document.

## Writing in the GUI editor

A GUI editor is provided for users who are not familiar with YAML syntax. In the GUI editor, you can use basic functions such as installing and running apps and running test scripts.

**If you want to use actions or arguments that are not provided by the GUI editor, you must use the YAML editor.**

1. Enter a routine name.
   <img
     src="/img/routine/gui-editor-name.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
2. Add or delete tasks, or change their location.
3. Add, delete or reposition steps within the job.

### Job

:::tip

Tasks run in parallel unless they are linked as predecessors.

:::

1. Job name
   - You can enter or edit the task name.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-job-name.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
2. Predecessor job
   - You can select a predecessor before executing the task. You can select multiple actions.
   - When the selected task is completed, the task will be executed.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-predecessors.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
3. Browser or app package name
   - For web template: You can choose the browser in which the job will run.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-browser-name.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
   - For mobile app, game templates: You can select the app package name where the task will be executed.
     :::tip
     Automatically downloads the app with the latest build version from the list of apps with the same package name.
     :::
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-package-name.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
4. Device
   - You can choose the device or device tag on which the job will run.
   - If group execution is disabled, one device with the selected tag will be randomly chosen to execute the job. If you select a specific device, that device will be used for execution.
   - If group execution is enabled, all devices with the selected tag from devices allocated to the project or public devices will be used for execution.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-device.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
5. Record device screen
   - Choose whether to record the device screen when the task is executed.
   - If you enable the recording option, you can view the video on the device job result page.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-screen-record.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />

### Step

:::tip

Steps are executed sequentially.

:::

1. Step name
   - You can enter or edit the step name.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-step-name.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
2. Step types
   - You can choose between actions and shell commands.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-step-type.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
3. Actions
   - Define what the step should do.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-step-action.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
   - The GUI editor provides three options:
     - **Run test (Recommended)**: Execute the test script.
     - **Prepare**: Install and run the app. Select the app version to install for the job.
     - **Checkout**: Fetch the repository linked from the Git storage.
4. Shell commands
   - Enter the shell command to be executed in this step.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-step-shell.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />

## Writing in the YAML editor

With the YAML editor, you can use various actions and arguments not provided by the GUI editor.

:::info

For routine YAML syntax, see [Routine YAML syntax](./syntax).
