You can define and automate the execution of web, mobile app, and game testing flows through routines, integrating them with CI/CD. This document explains examples of routine creation and CI/CD integration.

## Routine examples

The examples are based on `YAML` and can also be created using a GUI editor.

### Cross-Browser testing

Cross-browser testing ensures that your application works correctly in all browsers. The example below demonstrates a routine that performs tests simultaneously on multiple browsers using **a single test script**.

:::tip Host Device

Host devices on macOS and Windows platforms can run multiple `job` instances concurrently.

For more details, refer to the [Device Settings](/management/organization/device-farm/device-management#update-device-settings) guide.

```yaml title="web_test.yaml"
name: web_test

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  # By default, jobs run concurrently.
  test-chrome:
    runs-on: macos
    browserName: chrome
    record: true
    steps:
      - name: run test
        uses: dogu-actions/run-test
        with:
          checkout: true
          environment: node
          command: |
            npm install
            npm run test:web
        cwd: selenium/typescript/jest

  test-firefox:
    runs-on: macos
    browserName: firefox
    record: true
    steps:
      - name: run test
        uses: dogu-actions/run-test
        with:
          checkout: true
          environment: node
          command: |
            npm install
            npm run test:web
        cwd: selenium/typescript/jest

  test-edge:
    runs-on: macos
    browserName: edge
    record: true
    steps:
      - name: run test
        uses: dogu-actions/run-test
        with:
          checkout: true
          environment: node
          command: |
            npm install
            npm run test:web
        cwd: selenium/typescript/jest

  test-safari:
    runs-on: macos
    browserName: safari
    record: true
    steps:
      - name: run test
        uses: dogu-actions/run-test
        with:
          checkout: true
          environment: node
          command: |
            npm install
            npm run test:web
        cwd: selenium/typescript/jest
```

### Cross-Platform mobile app and game testing

The following example demonstrates a routine for cross-platform mobile app and game testing (Android and iOS). By specifying `group` in the `runs-on` attribute, it runs tests on **all devices** with `android` and `ios` tags.

:::info Prerequisites

To perform app and game testing, you need to upload the project's app.

For more details, refer to the [App Management](/management/project/app) guide.

:::

```yaml title="app_test.yaml"
name: app_test

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  # By default, jobs run concurrently.
  test-android:
    runs-on:
      # Through group execution, the tests will be run on all devices with these tags.
      group:
        - android
    appPackageName:
      # Automatically download the app with the latest build version from the list of apps with the same package name.
      android: com.dogutech.app
    record: true
    steps:
      - name: run test
        uses: dogu-actions/run-test
        with:
          checkout: true
          environment: python
          command: |
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            pytest app/test_android.py --capture=no -x
        cwd: app/python/pytest

  test-ios:
    runs-on:
      group:
        - ios
    appPackageName:
      ios: com.dogutech.app
    record: true
    steps:
      - name: run test
        uses: dogu-actions/run-test
        with:
          checkout: true
          environment: python
          command: |
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            pytest app/test_ios.py --capture=no -x
        cwd: app/python/pytest
```

## CI/CD integration examples

Routines are most effective when integrated with CI/CD tools. This example explains how to run routines using GitHub Actions.

:::info

Dogu supports integration with GitHub Actions and Jenkins.

- [Jenkins](/integration/cicd/jenkins)

:::

### GitHub Actions

Let's assume you want to deploy to a staging environment and perform testing before a production release. In most cases, you would write an action like this:

```yaml release-staging.yml
name: release-staging

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

job:
  build:
    runs-on: my-device
    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: install dependencies
        run: yarn install
      - name: build
        run: yarn build
  release:
    runs-on: my-device
    steps:
      - name: release
        run: do something...
```

Running routines is straightforward! You can run routines using the [dogu-github-action](https://github.com/dogu-team/dogu-github-action).

:::tip

Refer to the respective guides for your project ID, routine ID, and API token.

- [Project ID](/management/project/settings)
- [Routine ID](/management/project/routine#check-routine-id)
- [API Token](/api)

:::

```yaml release-staging.yml
# Omitted
release:
  runs-on: my-device
  steps:
    - name: release
      run: do something...
run-dogu-routine:
  runs-on: my-device
  steps:
    - name: run dogu routine
      uses: dogu-team/dogu-github-action@v1.0
      with:
        template: 'run_routine'
        project-id: 'my project id'
        routine-id: 'my routine id'
        api-url: https://api.dogutech.io # If you are in a Self-Hosted environment, provide the URL.
      env:
        DOGU_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DOGU_TOKEN }}
```

#### App upload

For mobile app and game testing, you need to upload the app to your project. This process should be done before running routines.

Let's assume the app is generated during the app build process and is located at `./sample.apk`.

You can do it like this:

```yaml release-staging.yml
# Omitted
build:
  runs-on: my-device
  run: ./gradlew assembleRelease
release:
  runs-on: my-device
  steps:
    - name: release
      run: do something...
upload-app:
  runs-on: my-device
  steps:
    - name: upload to Dogu
      uses: dogu-team/dogu-github-action@v1.0
      with:
        template: 'upload_app'
        project-id: 'my project id'
        file-path: ./sample.apk
        api-url: https://api.dogutech.io # If you are in a Self-Hosted environment, provide

 the URL.
      env:
        DOGU_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DOGU_TOKEN }}
run-dogu-routine:
  runs-on: my-device
  steps:
    - name: run dogu routine
      uses: dogu-team/dogu-github-action@v1.0
      with:
        template: 'run_routine'
        project-id: 'my project id'
        routine-id: 'my routine id'
        api-url: https://api.dogutech.io # If you are in a Self-Hosted environment, provide the URL.
      env:
        DOGU_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DOGU_TOKEN }}
```
