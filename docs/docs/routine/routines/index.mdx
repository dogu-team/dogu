- test script
- uploaded app (not required if using the web template)
- Connected device

:::

Dogu provides a **routine** feature for performing automated tests.  
A routine is a set of test cases used to perform automated testing. Routines define how to run test cases, and record the results of the execution of test cases.
Routines can be created without restrictions in one project.

This document covers how to create routines using the GUI, routine actions, YAML syntax, and more.

:::info

Routines are managed by projects. For how to handle routines within a project, please refer to the [routine management](/management/project/routine) document.

## Definition of terms

### Routine

Routine means that one test routine is created based on multiple devices and multiple test scripts.

Terms related to Routine are as follows.

| Term       | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Routine    | running some commands on multiple devices                                                                                               |
| Pipeline   | A sub-unit of a routine, executing a routine creates a pipeline.                                                                        |
| Job        | A subunit of a pipeline that creates tasks defined by routines when the pipeline runs..                                                 |
| Device Job | It is the same concept as a job, but refers to a job by the subject (device) that executes the job..                                    |
| Step       | As a sub-unit of the device job, when the device job is executed, the step defined as a sub-unit of the job in the routine is created.. |

:::tip task, step execution sequence

The routine's job and device job run in parallel if there is no antecedent connection. Steps always run sequentially.

:::

### Test script

Even within test scripts, there are terms related to routines.

| Term | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Job  | A grouping of multiple tests defined by a test script into one conceptual subject.                           |
| Test | It is the smallest unit of testing. As a subunit of Job, it means one test unit defined in the test script.. |

## Routine flow

The routine execution has the following flow:

1. Create a routine.
   - Define which test scripts to run with which devices and with which apps.
2. Run the routine.
3. The pipeline is created and the pipeline runs.
   - Pipelines are created each time you run a routine.
   - Pipelines are created based on routine definitions.
4. When the pipeline completes, check the results.

:::caution Device Queue

A device can only run one job. Devices that are already running other routines or script tests cannot run other tasks. Any work to be done after that will be queued.

The host device can execute multiple jobs simultaneously. You can specify the maximum number of parallel jobs through [device settings](/management/organization/device-farm/device-management#update-device-settings).
