When defining routines in YAML, use the following syntax:

## name

<code
  style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-20px', fontSize: '90%', color: 'red' }}
  children="required"
/>

---

Defines the name of the routine.

> Example
>
> ```yaml
> name: sample-routine
> ```

## on

<code
  style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-20px', fontSize: '90%', color: 'red' }}
  children="required"
/>

Type: `{ workflow_dispatch: empty string }`

:::caution

Currently, no separate values ​​are entered.

```
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```

:::

---

Define when the routine runs.

<br />

**Properties**

- `workflow_dispatch`

> 예시
>
> ```yaml
> on:
>   workflow_dispatch:
> ```

## env

<code
  style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-20px', fontSize: '90%' }}
  children="optional"
/>

:::caution environment variable precedence

The `env` property defines environment variables to be used throughout the routine. The `env` property inside the `step` property defines environment variables to be used in the step.
If an environment variable with the same `env` key name is defined both throughout the routine and in `step`, the environment variable defined in `step` takes precedence.

:::

---

Defines environment variables to be used by routines. It can be defined in the form of key-value pairs.

> Example
>
> ```yaml
> env:
>   key1: value1
>   key2: value2
> ```
>
> Define environment variables named `key1` and `key2`. The respective values ​​are `value1` and `value2`.

## jobs

<code
  style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-20px', fontSize: '90%', color: 'red' }}
  children="required"
/>

---

A list of Jobs to be executed in the routine. Jobs run **in parallel** by default.

> Example
>
> ```yaml
> jobs:
>   job1:
>     runs-on:
>       group: host
>     steps:
>       - name: step1
>         run: echo step1...
> ```
>
> Define a Job named job1.<br />
> job1 runs on the device tagged with "host", and job1 runs a step named step1.

## jobs.&lt;job-name&gt;.runs-on

<code
  style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-20px', fontSize: '90%', color: 'red' }}
  children="required"
/>

---

Defines the environment in which the Job will be executed. It can be specified as a device tag name or a specific device name.

### Designate as a specific device name or tag

1. Run single devices

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     job1:
       runs-on: your-device-name
       steps:
         - name: step1
           run: echo step1...
   ```

2. Run multiple devices
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     job1:
       runs-on:
         - your-device-name1
         - your-device-name2
       steps:
         - name: step1
           run: echo step1...
   ```
3. Run by device tag: Executes on a device corresponding to **`your-device-tag`**.
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     job1:
       runs-on:
         - your-device-tag
       steps:
         - name: step1
           run: echo step1...
   ```
4. Run by device tag and device name: Executes on a device corresponding to **`your-device-tag`** and a device with the name **`your-device-name`**.
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     job1:
       runs-on:
         - your-device-tag
         - your-device-name
       steps:
         - name: step1
           run: echo step1...
   ```

### Running on all devices with a specific device tag

:::tip `group`

Specify the device tag name. The job will run on all devices with that tag.

:::

1. Execute one device tag
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     job1:
       runs-on:
         # Runs on all devices tagged with host
         group: host
       steps:
         - name: step1
           run: echo step1...
   ```
2. Running multiple device tags
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     job1:
       runs-on:
         # Runs on all devices tagged test1 and test2
         group:
           - test1
           - test2
       steps:
         - name: step1
           run: echo step1...
   ```

:::info device tag

Documentation related to device tags can be found [here](/management/organization/device-farm/tag-management).

:::

## jobs.&lt;job-name&gt;.needs

<code
  style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-20px', fontSize: '90%' }}
  children="optional"
/>

---

Defines the order of job execution. The job specified in the `needs` property is executed first, followed by the current job.

**Examples**

```yaml
# job1 runs first, then job2 runs.
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on:
      group: host
    steps:
      - name: step1
        run: echo step1...

  job2:
    needs: job1
    runs-on:
      group: host
    steps:
      - name: step2
        run: echo step2...
```

```yaml
# job1 and job2 run concurrently. job3 will be executed after both job1 and job2 finish.
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on:
      group: host
    steps:
      - name: step1
        run: echo step1...

  job2:
    runs-on:
      group: host
    steps:
      - name: step1
        run: echo step1...

  job3:
    needs:
      - job1
      - job2
    runs-on:
      group: host
    steps:
      - name: step2
        run: echo step2..
```

```yaml
# job1 and job2 run concurrently.
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on:
      group: host
    steps:
      - name: step1
        run: echo step1...

  job2:
    runs-on:
      group: android
    steps:
      - name: step1
        run: echo step1...
```

:::caution Jobs running concurrently have the same runs-on

```yaml
# job1 and job2 run concurrently.
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on:
      group: host
    steps:
      - name: step1
        run: echo step1...

  job2:
    runs-on:
      group: android
    steps:
      - name: step1
        run: echo step1...
```

If, in the example above, `job2` also specifies the "host" tag, both jobs are executed simultaneously, but the device with the "host" tag by `job1` is in use, so it waits until `job1` is finished. At this time, the order follows the Job order.

:::

## jobs.&lt;job-name&gt;.record

<code
  style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-20px', fontSize: '90%' }}
  children="optional"
/>

Default: `false`

---

Defines whether to record the screen of the device when the Job is executed.
If it is `true`, all devices defined in `runs-on` of the Job will record video.

> Example
>
> ```yaml
> jobs:
>   job1:
>     runs-on:
>       group: android
>     # Record the screen of a device tagged with android.
>     record: true
> ```

## jobs.&lt;job-name&gt;.browserName

<code
  style={{ position: 'relative', top: '-20px', fontSize: '90%' }}
  children="optional"
/>

Default: `null`

---

:::info

:::

Select the browser to run in the job. **You cannot select multiple browsers.**

:::tip

If you want to run tests on multiple browsers, refer to the [Routine Examples](/routine/routines/examples).

:::

Possible browsers are as follows:

- `chrome`
- `firefox`
- `safari`
- `edge`

---

Define environment variables to be used in step. It can be defined in the form of key-value pairs.

> Example
>
> ```yaml
> jobs:
>   job1:
>     runs-on:
>       group: android
>     steps:

>         env:
>           key1: value1
>           key2: value2
> ```

### Environment variable priority

Environment variables have the following priority:

1. Environment variable defined as `env` property in step
2. Environment variables defined globally with the `env` attribute

```yaml
name: test
# Environment variables defined globally in the routine
env:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on:
      group: android
    steps:
      - name: step1
        # environment variable defined in step
        env:
          key1: value3
          key3: value4
        run: echo step1...
```

In the example above, `step1` uses the following environment variables.

```yaml
key1: value3
key2: value2
key3: value4
```
