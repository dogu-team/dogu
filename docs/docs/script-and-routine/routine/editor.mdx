You can create routines in the Dogu console in two ways.

:::info Prerequisites

To write a routine, you need to upload an app to the project and write a test script.

Please refer to [App Management](/organization-and-project/project/app) and [Test Script](../test-script/about) documents for each information.

:::

## Writing in the GUI editor

A GUI editor is provided for users who are not familiar with YAML syntax. In the GUI editor, you can use basic functions such as installing and running apps and running test scripts.

**If you want to use actions or arguments that are not provided by the GUI editor, you must use the YAML editor.**

1. Enter a routine name.
   <img
     src="/img/routine/gui-editor-name.png"
     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
2. Add or delete tasks, or change their location.
3. Add, delete or reposition steps within the job.

### Job

:::tip

Tasks run in parallel unless they are linked as predecessors.

:::

1. job name
   - You can enter or edit the task name.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-job-name.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
2. predecessor job

   - You can select a predecessor before executing the task. You can select multiple actions.
   - When the selected task is completed, the task will be executed.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-predecessors.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />

3. Device tag
   - You can select the device tag on which the task will run. You can select multiple tags.
   - Devices assigned to the project or devices with tags selected from public devices are all executed.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-device-tag.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
4. Record device screen
   - Choose whether to record the device screen when the task is executed.
   - If you enable the recording option, you can view the video on the device job result page.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-screen-record.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />

### Step

:::tip

Steps are executed sequentially.

:::

1. Step name
   - You can enter or edit the step name.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-step-name.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
2. Action

   - Define what the step does.
     <img
       src="/img/routine/gui-editor-step-action.png"
       style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
     />
   - The GUI editor provides two options.

     - **Install and run app**: Install and run the app. Select the app version to install from the list of apps.

       <img
         src="/img/routine/gui-editor-app-version.png"
         style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
       />

     - **Run test**: Runs the test script. Select the script to run from the list of test scripts.

:::caution action sequence

The order of actions is very important for execution. If I don't install the app and run the test script, the test script fails.

Therefore, after executing the `Install app and run` action, the `Run test` action must be executed for it to work. For more information on actions, see the [Actions](./actions/about) document.
:::

:::tip

If you continuously test with the same version of the app in multiple tasks or within one task, you only need to define the step using the `Install app and run` action at the very beginning.

:::

## Writing in the YAML editor

With the YAML editor, you can use various actions and arguments not provided by the GUI editor.

:::info

For routine YAML syntax, see [Routine YAML syntax](./syntax).
