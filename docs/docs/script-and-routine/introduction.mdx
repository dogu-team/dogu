Dogu provides **routines** for testing game automation.

:::info

Routines are managed by projects. For how to handle routines within a project, please refer to the [routine management](/organization-and-project/project/routine) document.

## Definition of terms

### Routine

Routine means that one test routine is created based on multiple devices and multiple test scripts for one game.

Terms related to Routine are as follows.

| Term       | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Routine    | running some commands on multiple devices                                                                                               |
| Pipeline   | A sub-unit of a routine, executing a routine creates a pipeline.                                                                        |
| Job        | A subunit of a pipeline that creates tasks defined by routines when the pipeline runs..                                                 |
| Device Job | It is the same concept as a job, but refers to a job by the subject (device) that executes the job..                                    |
| Step       | As a sub-unit of the device job, when the device job is executed, the step defined as a sub-unit of the job in the routine is created.. |

:::tip task, step execution sequence

The routine's job and device job run in parallel if there is no antecedent connection. Steps always run sequentially.

### Test script

Even within test scripts, there are terms related to routines.

| Term | Description                                                                                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Job  | A grouping of multiple tests defined by a test script into one conceptual subject.                                |
| Test | It is the smallest unit of game testing. As a subunit of Job, it means one test unit defined in the test script.. |

## Routine flow

The routine execution has the following flow:

2. Create a routine.
   - Define which test scripts to run with which devices and with which apps.
3. Run the routine.
4. The pipeline is created and the pipeline runs.
   - Pipelines are created each time you run a routine.
   - Pipelines are created based on routine definitions.
5. When the pipeline completes, check the results.

:::caution Device Queue

A device can only run one job. Devices that are already running other routines or script tests cannot run other tasks. Any work to be done after that will be queued.

:::

:::tip

To run the routine, the following items must be prepared.

- group
- project
- test script
- Connected device
