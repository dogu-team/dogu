Write test scripts and create routines, run the routines and provide a report of the test. The test report can be viewed by clicking Device Activity.

1. Click on the "Routines" tab on the project page.
2. Click on the pipeline to view the results.

Test results vary slightly depending on the device operation or step.

## Device Job

In Device Jobs, you can check the following information:

### Recording video

:::info

The recorded video is displayed after activating the option when writing a routine and completing the device operation.

For instructions on how to write a routine, refer to [Routine Editor](/routine/routines/editor) or [Routine YAML Grammar](/routine/routines/syntax).

:::

You can check the recorded video in device operation. You can adjust the video duration by clicking the button for each step or subtest unit.

### Device profile information

You can check your device's CPU usage, memory usage, and game FPS graphs.

/>

1. CPU Usage
   - CPU Usage displays the `user` CPU usage of the current device, the `system` CPU usage, and the CPU usage of the process currently running on the device.
2. Memory Usage
   - Memory usage shows the total memory of the current device, the memory in use, and the memory usage of the process currently running on the device.
3. Gaming FPS
   - Game FPS displays the FPS of the game currently running on the device.

:::info FPS

In order to receive game FPS information, the game project must include the Gamium Engine SDK. For details, refer to [Gamium Engine SDK](https://gamium.dogutech.io/docs/engine/unity/project-configuration).

:::

### Live logs

:::info

A live log is displayed when the device task is running. After the device operation is finished, check the log from the staff.

:::

In the live log, you can check the device log and test script log.

### Step list

You can check the list of steps executed in the device task. A step is a step defined inside a job in a routine.

  style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
/>

## Step

In the step, you can check the following information.

### Test

It can be checked in the case of the step executing the test script. A list of tests to perform is displayed.

  style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
/>

### Log

When the step ends, you can check the log. You can check the device log and test script log in the same way as the device operation.

### Device profile

When the step ends, you can check the device profile graph. You can check CPU usage, memory usage, and game FPS graphs the same as device operation.

## Test

For tests, a list of `Job` and `Test` defined in the test script is displayed.

In the test, you can check the following information.

:::info

In `Job`, the list of `Test` defined in the test script is listed.

:::

:::caution

If the execution time of the defined `Test` is short, information may not be displayed.

:::

### Log

When `Test` ends, you can check the log. You can check the device log and test script log in the same way as the device operation.

  style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
/>

### Device profile

When `Test` is finished, you can check the device profile graph. You can check CPU usage, memory usage, and game FPS graphs the same as device operation.
