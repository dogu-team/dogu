## Pytest Hooks

Dogu hooks are functions that are called by the Dogu sdk at certain points in the Dogu lifecycle. They can be used to customize the Dogu's behavior.

### `def pytest_dogu_create_client() -> DoguClient`

This hook is called when the Dogu is started. It should return a `DoguClient` instance that is used to communicate with the Dogu.

## Pytest Fixtures

Dogu fixtures are available to use in your tests. They can be used to customize the test's behavior.

### `dogu_config`

The Dogu's configuration. `dogu.config.json` is parsed and passed to this fixture.  
type is `DoguConfig`.

### `dogu_client`

The `DoguClient` instance that is returned by the `pytest_dogu_create_client` hook.

## Dogu Interfaces

### `class DoguClient`

#### `impl: Any`

The implementation of the client. `on_setup` return value is stored here.

#### `def on_setup(dogu_config: DoguConfig) -> Any`

`abstract method`

Called after `dogu_config` is parsed and before the test starts.  
`dogu_config` is the Dogu's configuration. `dogu.config.json` is parsed and passed to this method.  
Return your client implementation here then it will be stored in `self.impl`.

#### `def dogu_results() -> Dict[str, Any]`

Called after the `on_setup` method.  
Return a dictionary that will be have `remoteDeviceJobId`. This will be used to report the results to the server.

#### `def on_teardown() -> None`

`abstract method`

Called after the test ends.  
Do cleanup here with `self.impl`.

#### `def cast(self, cls: Type[T]) -> T`

Returns the `self.impl` casted to `cls` type.  
Use this method to access the client implementation.
