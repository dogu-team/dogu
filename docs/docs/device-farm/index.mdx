Dogu aims to manage devices on various platforms such as Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS in one place.
To realize this, we introduced the concept of `host` and `device`.

### Device {#device}

A `device` means a device with a platform such as Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, etc. Devices are not limited to the Desktop platform. It can be a desktop device or a mobile device.
Anything that can be controlled and orchestrated through software can be considered a device in Dogu.

Currently, Dogu supports Windows, Mac, and Android devices.
