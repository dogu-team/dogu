## Checking device connection

### Check the cable

1. Run a shell on the host through Terminal, Powershell, etc., and go to the path where android platform-tools is installed..

   ```sh
   $cd $HOME/.dogu/externals/android/platform-tools
   ```

2. Enter the command `adb devices`.

   ```sh
   $adb devices
   ```

   - `offline`: When connecting the device to the host PC, choose to allow the device or enable the USB debugging option in the developer options on the device.
     Try changing the USB usage mode on the device.
   - `unauthorized`: When connecting the device to the host PC, choose to allow the device or enable the USB debugging option in the developer options on the device.

   - If you are using Automatically manage signing, please delete files in $HOME/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles folder before rebuild..

   - Run `Rebuild & Check` to see if the current build is not being built due to an unexpected error (ex. certificate expiration).
   - Click the `Open WebDriverAgent project` button to open the WebDriverAgent project, set the Target to WebDriverAgentRunner and the Target Device to the device with the problem, run a test build, and check if the app runs normally on the device.

     <img src={xcode_wda_testbuild} style={{ width: 450 }} />

     - If you see Testing WebDriverAgentRunner as below, it's OK.

     <img src={xcode_wda_running} style={{ width: 600 }} />

   - Click the `Open iOSDeviceAgent project` button, open the iOSDeviceAgent project, set the Target to DoguDevRunner and the Target Device to the device with the problem, run a test build, and check if the app runs normally on the device..

     <img src={xcode_ida_testbuild} style={{ width: 450 }} />

     - It's OK if you see Testing DoguDevRunner as below.

     <img src={xcode_ida_running} style={{ width: 600 }} />

   - Check if there is a warning message in the device status. A device with a warning message will not be recognized by Dogu Agent unless the warning message is resolved..

     <img src={ios_devices_simulators_alert} style={{ width: 500 }} />

4. Make sure Developer is Untrusted on your iOS device.

- Please refer to the [OSXDaily article](https://osxdaily.com/2021/05/07/how-to-trust-an-app-on-iphone-ipad-to-fix-untrusted-developer-message/) to set the current developer to be trusted..
