### Troubleshooting by platform

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

1. Run a shell on the host through Terminal, Powershell, etc., and go to the path where android platform-tools is installed..

   ```sh
   cd $HOME/.dogu/externals/android/platform-tools
   ```

2. Enter the command `adb devices`.

   ```sh
   adb devices
   ```

   - `offline`: Failed to connect with ADB daemon (adbd) running on device.([reference](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/adb/+/HEAD/OVERVIEW.TXT)) Temporary measures can be taken by rebooting the device.
   - `unauthorized`: When connecting the device to the host PC, choose to allow the device or enable the USB debugging option in the developer options on the device.
   - `device`: The device is successfully connected. In this case, try restarting Dogu Agent.

- If the connection is not successful after the above methods, try restarting the Android device.

#### Device settings

1. Make sure Developer is Untrusted on your iOS device.

- Please refer to the [OSXDaily article](https://osxdaily.com/2021/05/07/how-to-trust-an-app-on-iphone-ipad-to-fix-untrusted-developer-message/) to set the current developer to be trusted..
- If it is executed by pressing the DoguDev app and WebDriverAgentRunner app installed on the iOS device, it is Trusted..

#### Device lookup

1. Click `View Devices and Simulators` in Dogu Agent to launch the Devices window in Xcode..

   <img src={dost_ios_view_devices} style={{ width: 450 }} />

   - Make sure your devices are displayed in the list.

     <img src={ios_devices_simulators_view} style={{ width: 200 }} />

   - Check if there is a warning message in the device status. A device with a warning message will not be recognized by Dogu Agent unless the warning message is resolved..

     <img src={ios_devices_simulators_alert} style={{ width: 500 }} />

2. Open Terminal on macOS and run the command below.
   ```sh
   xctrace list devices
   ```
   - Please check if the device is displayed as below.
     <img src={xctrace_llist_devices} style={{ width: 500 }} />

#### Confirm device registration

1. Please refer to the [Register a single device](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/register-devices/register-a-single-device) document to ensure that the device is registered to your Apple Developer account..

   - Rebuild is required if the device is newly registered.

#### Rebuild

1. Please check if all iOS Settings items are completed in Dogu Agent.

   <img src={dost_ios_settings} style={{ width: 500 }} />

   - The Apple account used to set up the Provisioning Profile must be an account registered with the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)

   - If you are using Automatically manage signing, please delete files in $HOME/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles folder before rebuild..

   - Run `Rebuild & Check` to see if the current build is not being built due to an unexpected error (ex. certificate expiration).
   - Click the `Open WebDriverAgent project` button to open the WebDriverAgent project, set the Target to WebDriverAgentRunner and the Target Device to the device with the problem, run a test build, and check if the app runs normally on the device.

     <img src={xcode_wda_testbuild} style={{ width: 450 }} />

     - If you see Testing WebDriverAgentRunner as below, it's OK.

     <img src={xcode_wda_running} style={{ width: 600 }} />

   - Click the `Open iOSDeviceAgent project` button, open the iOSDeviceAgent project, set the Target to DoguDevRunner and the Target Device to the device with the problem, run a test build, and check if the app runs normally on the device..

     - It's OK if you see Testing DoguDevRunner as below.

     <img src={xcode_ida_running} style={{ width: 600 }} />
