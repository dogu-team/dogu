### iOS Settings

<img src={dost_macos_manual_setup} style={{ width: 600 }} />

iOS requires special setup to install on devices inside the organization, as installation is limited unless the app has been uploaded to the AppStore. One of these special settings is Manual Setup. At this time, I will explain below based on [Automatic signing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-to-registered-devices#Register-devices-automatically-in-Xcode) among the methods of installing certified apps on iOS devices. If you are using manual signing, you can use the organization's internal certificate and provisioning profile.

- Xcode

  - It is the basic tool you need when controlling connected iOS devices from macOS. It can be installed from [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
  - After installation, please log in as below. At this time, the Apple account must be an account within the organization that has joined the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).

    <img src={xcode_login_0} style={{ width: 200 }} /> <br></br>
    <img src={xcode_login_1} style={{ width: 400 }} /> <br></br>
    <img src={xcode_login_2} style={{ width: 400 }} /> <br></br>

- WebDriverAgent
  - This is a necessary app for iOS test automation..
  - Open the project by pressing the `WebDriverAgent Project` button.
  - Signing of WebDriverAgentRunner by pressing the button in the red box from the left as shown in the picture below.
  - Please select Team. Please select the name of the organization that has joined the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).
  - Afterwards, if the warning message or error message disappears, return to Dogu Agent and click the `Click here to build` button..
  - When the build is complete, press the ‘Check’ button to make a green check mark appear..
    <img src={xcode_webdriveragent} style={{ width: 700 }} /> <br></br>
- iOSDeviceAgent
  - This app is necessary for real-time screen transmission and input..
  - Open the project by pressing the ‘iOSDeviceAgent Project’ button.
  - Signing of DoguDev by pressing the button in the red box from the left as shown in the picture below.
  - Please select Team. Please select the name of the organization that has joined the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).
  - Afterwards, check if the warning message or error message has disappeared..
  - Please do the same for DoguDevRunner, DoguRunner, and DoguScreen as well as DoguDev..
  - Go back to Dogu Agent and hit the 'Click here to build' button.
  - When the build is complete, press the ‘Check’ button to make a green check mark appear..
    <img src={xcode_iosdeviceagent} style={{ width: 700 }} /> <br></br>

:::caution
WebDriverAgent and iOSDeviceAgent can be installed and executed only on iOS devices registered in [Apple Developer Console](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/devices/list). Refer to [Register devices in your developer account](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-to-registered-devices#Register-devices-in-your-developer-account) and ask the organization manager to register the device..
