Projects are designed for testing and providing results for game projects. Within a project, you can perform test executions, control devices, manage members, write test scripts, and manage routines, among other testing-related functionalities.

For the features and functionalities provided or managed within a project, please refer to the respective documentation.

:::tip

**To ensure accurate statistics for test results, it is strongly recommended not to mix tests for different games within the same project.**
