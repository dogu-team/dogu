Even if you don't create a routine in the Dogu console, you can still execute the test scripts you have written.

## Run a script testing

:::danger Working Device

Script testing is also considered a device operation. If the device is already executing a routine or another script test, the script test cannot be performed.

Make sure the device is not running a routine before executing the script test.

:::

1. Click on the "Script test" tab within the project.

     style={{ width: 600, display: 'block' }}
   />
2. In the left file explorer, select the script you want to test.

   <img

     style={{ width: 800, display: 'block' }}
   />

   <br />

   :::info File Explorer

   The folders displayed in the file explorer are the ones specified in the repository settings. Refer to the repository settings document for more information.

   :::

3. On the top right, select the device on which you want to run the test script.

   <img

     style={{ width: 800, display: 'block' }}
   />

   <br />

   <br />

   :::tip Behavior without Specifying an App

   If you don't select an app, the currently running app on the device will be used. The app used must have the [Gamium Engine SDK](https://gamium.dogutech.io/docs/engine/unity/project-configuration) installed.

   **Make sure to run the app so that the test script can be executed.**

   :::

   :::info App Upload

   If you haven't uploaded an app, refer to the [Managing Apps](./app) document to upload an app.
