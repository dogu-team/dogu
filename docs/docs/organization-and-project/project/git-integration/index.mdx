From `Dogu v1.2.0` onwards, self-hosted GitLab hosting is not supported for the test script repository. You can use GitHub and GitLab services to integrate with projects.

## Prerequisites

:::tip

You can check the repository example at https://github.com/dogu-team/test-script-sample.

:::

1. Create a repository in a Git service.
2. Create a `dogu.config.json` file in the **root directory** with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "scriptFolderPaths": ["test"]
   }
   ```
3. Write test scripts in the path specified in `scriptFolderPaths`.

## Integration

:::info

To perform actions such as repository tree browsing, file retrieval, and cloning in Dogu, at least read permission for the repository is required.  
Please refer to the token generation pages for each Git service for more details.

:::

1. Go to the Dogu project page.
2. Select the project to integrate and go to the settings page.
3. Click on the "Change Git Integration" button.

### Verify Integration

2. Select the routines tab and click the `+` icon.
