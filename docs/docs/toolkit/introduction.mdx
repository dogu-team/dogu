# Toolkit introduction

Toolkit is a package that provides game control and device control functions.

`Gamium` is an SDK that can automate gameplay. Through `Gamium`, it provides the ability to script the actions of game users.
`Gamium` can control internal elements of the game engine, but native device control is not possible. For example, if Gamium Engine is applied to Unity, UI elements created by Unity can be controlled. However, you cannot control Android's permission window.

However, among the processes of installation, execution, and testing, there are frequent cases where native device control is required or required.
To solve this case, Dogu has developed Toolkit.

## Starting

Toolkit is a package that includes Gamium and device control functions. This means that you can install and run apps on a specific device, control the game UI, and control the device with just one Toolkit.
You can get started with the Toolkit through the [quick-start] document.
