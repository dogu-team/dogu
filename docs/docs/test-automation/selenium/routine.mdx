Describes details when running browser tests with routine. Please refer to the [Tutorial](/get-started/tutorials/test-automation/routine-testing/selenium) on how to run Selenium tests with routine.

## Autoinstall browsers

If you call ensureBrowserAndDriver() using dogu-device-client, the browser for testing will be automatically installed. An example of using dogu-device-client can be found at [dogu-routine-examples](https://github.com/dogu-team/dogu-routine-examples).
