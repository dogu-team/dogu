Dogu supports test automation tools such as Selnium, Appium, Gamium, and Playwright. You can perform test automation by linking with these tools.
You can simply test on a single device through remote testing, and you can test multiple devices through routines. Automate tests by linking Dogu with the testing framework you use or want to use, and check the results at a glance in the console.

If you haven't tried Dogu yet, try it through [Toturial](/get-started/tutorials).
This document explains additional settings when linking each Testing Framework.
