## Why Dogu?
It needs so many time and effort to build and maintain infrastructure like *Appium*, *OpenSTF*, *Jenkins*, *Grafana* for test automation.
Dogu provides **unified platform** for these infrastructure and helps you to focus on test automation.  
Especially, Dogu is tightly integrated with test script and test framework so that you can focus on test automation without developing infrastructure related works like parallel test execution, data transfer for test report.
